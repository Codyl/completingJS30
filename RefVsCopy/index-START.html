    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let myString = "Cody";
    let myNum = 1;
    let myBool = false;

    let newString = myString;
    newString = "Kiara";
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // let myPlayers = players;
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // myPlayers[2] = "Bob";

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    myPlayers = Array.from(players);
    myPlayers[2] ="Mary";
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let p2 = [].concat(players)
    p2[2] = "Phil";
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let p3 = [...players];
    p3[2] = "Spreadison";
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      friends : {
        martin: "The first",
        fartin: "THe worst"
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // let myPerson = person;
    // myPerson.name = "Will Bill";
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let personClone = Object.assign({}, person, {name: "drake"})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    let os = {...person};
    os.name = "sam"
    let os2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    os2.name = "bilbo"
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    os.friends.martin = "The second";
    os2.friends.martin = "The third";
